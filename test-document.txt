Test document content for uploading.

This is a simple text document that can be used to test the upload functionality of the NotebookLM mini clone.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test text chunking and processing.

Key features to test:
- Text processing and chunking
- Vector embedding creation
- Document storage in Qdrant
- Chat functionality with the uploaded content

This should be sufficient to verify that the upload and chat systems are working correctly.
